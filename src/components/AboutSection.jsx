          I'm Varad Nair, recently completed my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas, Arlington on May 2025. I have experience working across both frontend and backend systems, and I focus on building solutions that are both efficient and impactful.

          At <strong>Mavenir Systems</strong>, I pioneered backend network infrastructure and monitoring solutions using Python and Kubernetes, streamlining processes and improving scalability. I collaborated with 5+ cross-functional teams to optimize cloud infrastructure, enhance CI/CD workflows, and automate operational tasks using Bash scripting, leading to a 40% reduction in manual errors and deployment times.

          During my time at <strong>Tata Consultancy Services</strong>, I spearheaded data-driven projects analyzing terabytes of business data using Python, SQL, and Azure DevOps to identify process inefficiencies. I developed backend services for customer-facing applications, optimized data warehousing processes by 50%, and resolved over 30 production issues while working in agile teams, ensuring high-quality software delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy solving practical problems with AI and automation. Notable projects include <strong>Smart Spend</strong>, an AI-powered finance manager with predictive analytics built using Django and React, and <strong>Secure Phone Book</strong>, a role-based API platform ensuring secure access to sensitive contact information. Iâ€™ve also developed machine learning pipelines using TensorFlow and PyTorch for sentiment analysis tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, DevOps practices, and breaking down complex systems into simple, maintainable components that drive impactful solutions. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me at table tennis clubs, unwinding at cafÃ©s, or gaming my way through the evenings. ðŸ˜‰
